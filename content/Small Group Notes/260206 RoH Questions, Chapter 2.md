## 🌿 **General Discussion**

1. 🌟 **What do you think was the main theme(s) of the chapter?**

2. 💡 **Was there a particular idea or theme in the chapter that stood out to you or shaped your thinking?**

3. 📖 **Is there any text from the chapter for which you’d like the group’s input?**  
   Perhaps it was unclear what Willard meant or the Scripture from which he pulled the idea.

## 🧠 **Matters for Thought and Discussion**  
*(copied from the book)*

1. 🌱 **What is the relation between caring for something and understanding its nature?**  
   How does the contemporary battle over human nature affect our ability today to care for our own well-being and goodness?

2. ❤️ **What is the heart and what is its role in human life?**

3. 🔹 **What are the six basic aspects (or dimensions) of the human being?**  
   Does the list leave anything out?

4. ✨ **Relate the six dimensions to the great commandment (Luke 10:25–28)**  
   and to spiritual formation in Christ.

5. 🎭 **Explore the role feelings play in our current social and personal lives.**  
   In media and popular arts. In church activities. Would you say you are (sometimes? never? always?) controlled by your feelings?

6. 🔥 **Do you agree or disagree with the explanation of temptation set forth in this chapter?**

7. 🧩 **How does choice or volition depend upon thought and feeling?**  
   Why can’t we just change our will? (“Human life . . . does not run by will alone.”)

8. 👣 **Do you agree or disagree that actions really do tell who we are?**

9. 🏞️ **Is the comparison between Israel taking the Promised Land**  
   and our conquering by grace and action all the dimensions of our personality a valid one?
