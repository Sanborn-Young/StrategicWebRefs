# Sermon Outline - Pastor Jay at Westgate Church

## Introduction

Jay introduces himself as part of the team at Westgate Church and welcomes missionaries and ministry partners including Tukutana, Rancho Santa Marta, and Young Life.

## Opening Illustration: Scarr's Pizza

- Jay shares a personal story about visiting Scarr's Pizza in Chinatown, New York City after extensive research
    
- Core principle: "When something is this good, you have to tell people"
    
- Transition: This principle applies to sharing faith, not just pizza
    

## Main Theme: Living an Invitational Life

## The Problem: Gap Between Belief and Action

- Barna research data: 61% of Christian adults agree they have a responsibility to share their faith, but only 28% strongly agree they should actually do it personally
    
- This reveals a 33% gap between theoretical responsibility and personal action
    
- Jay confesses his own struggle: "I have often used the excuse that I do not have the gift of evangelism"
    

## Personal Testimony

- Jay shares how he came to faith through ordinary people in his early 20s
    
- A small group of guys invited him to eat pizza, watch Monday Night Football, and play video games
    
- Key insight: "God did not use extraordinary giftedness to change my life. God used ordinary attentiveness to change my life"
    

## Scripture Reading: [Acts 8:26-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A26-34&version=NIV)

## The Story of Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch

Jay re-reads the passage, highlighting:

- An angel directs Philip to the desert road from Jerusalem to Gaza
    
- Philip meets an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official, reading [Isaiah 53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&version=NIV)
    
- The Spirit tells Philip to approach the chariot
    
- The eunuch asks: "How can I [understand] unless someone explains it to me?"
    

## Context: Understanding the Ethiopian Eunuch

**Marginalized on Multiple Levels:**

1. **Physiologically and socially**: Eunuchs were marginalized outsiders in the first century
    
2. **Religiously as a non-Jew**: He traveled to Jerusalem to worship but was relegated to the outer court of the Gentiles
    
3. **In Ethiopia**: When he returned home, there was no center of Jewish worship
    

**The Cost of His Privilege:**

- His status as a royal official came at the cost of forced castration as a young boy
    
- He could serve in the royal court without posing a dynastic threat
    
- "His body was a reminder that his privilege came because of loss"
    

## Three Key Themes: Crisis, Curiosity, and Quest

## The Ethiopian Eunuch Embodied All Three:

1. **Crisis**: His entire life was marked by bodily pain and social marginalization
    
2. **Curiosity**: He was studying Jewish scriptures ([Isaiah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah&version=NIV))
    
3. **Quest**: He had made a worship pilgrimage to Jerusalem
    

## Application: Pay Attention to These Themes

Jay challenges the congregation:

- "Is there someone in your life who is in deep crisis?"
    
- "Is there someone who sort of hints to you from time to time that they have a curiosity about the deeper, more meaningful stuff of life?"
    
- "Is there someone you know who is on a quest, a spiritual quest, searching for meaning?"
    

## Modern Example: Reza's Story

## Meeting Reza

- Jay met Reza in summer 2023
    
- Reza approached Jay after a service: "I'm not a Christian, but can I meet with you?"
    
- Reza had grown up in church, deconstructed his faith, but was spiritually curious
    

## Reza's Journey

- Jay met with Reza consistently over two years
    
- Reza exhibited all three: crisis, curiosity, and quest
    
- Easter 2024: Reza raised his hand to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior
    
- Jay officiated Reza's wedding months later
    

## Key Insight

"It's not because I ever said anything profound to him... It's not because I'm a gifted missionary or evangelist... God decided in that circumstance to use me... as an embodiment of God's immense love for Reza. And it was an incredible privilege to be a part of that story, to just pay attention."

## Biblical Word Study: "The Way" (Hodos)

## [Acts 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8&version=NIV) - Emphasis on "Hodos" (The Way)

- [Acts 8:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A26&version=NIV): "Go south to the road [hodos]"
    
- [Acts 8:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A31&version=NIV): "How can I unless someone explains [hodegeo - shows me the way] it to me?"
    
- [Acts 8:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A36&version=NIV): "As they traveled along the road [hodos]"
    
- [Acts 8:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A39&version=NIV): "went on his way [hodos]"
    

## Historical Context

- Before being called "Christians," early followers of Jesus were called "followers of the Way [Hodos]"
    
- [Acts 9:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+9%3A1-2&version=NIV): Saul sought letters to find "any there who belonged to the Way"
    

## Application of "The Way"

"Living missionally means living attentively to those around us who might be looking for a new way. Those in crisis desperate for an alternative path... or those who are curious or on a spiritual quest seeking an alternative way that might finally bring hope and resolution and renewal."

## Jasmine's Story (Video Testimony)

## Background

- Jasmine grew up in Texas and Mexico with Catholic parents
    
- Moved to North Carolina at 16-17, lived with Jehovah's Witness aunt
    
- Experienced performative spirituality: "if you do more, you're more spiritual"
    
- Moved to California confused and searching
    

## The Turning Point

- Working at a bank, Jasmine prayed for help
    
- Her client Paul walked in
    
- During small talk, Jasmine mentioned "you can't talk about God openly"
    
- Paul invited her to Westgate
    

## Alpha Experience

- Attended Alpha (a safe space to ask questions about God)
    
- One night asked: "Do you think God loves you?"
    
- Table leader Heather responded without hesitation: "Yes, 100%"
    
- Jasmine realized: "Jesus made me in his image and therefore I had every characteristics of him so that was more than enough to know that he loved me"
    
- This was a "ground-shaky moment"
    
- Jasmine accepted Jesus and was baptized by Jay in 2026
    

## Alpha Ministry Update

## High School Alpha Launch

- The student ministry team prayed for 50 high school students
    
- Last Sunday: 101 high school students attended
    
- These are "15, 16, 17-year-old kids... not gifted evangelists... just attentive"
    

## Invitation to Alpha

**For Non-Christians:**

- If you're skeptical, in crisis, curious, or on a quest, join Alpha
    
- "I actually believe it's the most important thing that could happen in your life"
    

**For Christians:**

- Begin praying today for someone to invite to Alpha
    
- "One of the prayers God seems to answer pretty quickly... God, would you open my eyes to see those in my life who are far from you?"
    

## Closing Prayer and Response

Jay leads the congregation in prayer:

- For non-Christians: Suspend disbelief and open yourself to God's love
    
- For Christians: Pray for someone in crisis, curious, or on a quest
    
- Ask God for clear opportunities to give the gift of attention
    
- Ask for courage to invite people closer to God's love
