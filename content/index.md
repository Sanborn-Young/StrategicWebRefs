## A Place For Strategic Thoughts

Once you start to understand how to use [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)), it becomes obvious that it is a great notepad, workpad, and overall place to categorize all of your thoughts. However, every once in a while you are going to want to share some of those thoughts. 

You have a couple of different ways of doing that, but [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is especially suitable for being published directly to the web and still looking pretty good for something that takes very little effort. This particular website is created with [Quartz](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/quartz-publish-obsidian-vault/) and published through [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages). In essence, this makes it a free and easy way to share my thoughts with the world.

I have an inborn fascination with three theme:  the pursuit of business, the pursuit of productivity, and an intellectual understanding of if we are simply physical beings or if we have some attribute of our make-up that transcends beyond what we can observe with our senses.  This site serves to capture two of the three ideals in depth, and hint at the third.

## Getting Started If You Wanted To Do The Same

This site is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), a fast, batteries-included static-site generator.  This is a great package that leverages Github and Obsidian to make publication of parts of your notebook easy and fast.  

If the advent of LLMs, the ability to deploy a site like this can be done by virtually anybody, as long as they want to put in the time.
