[Sell-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_research) reports are very helpful as they will summarize SEC information, make models, and often carry along market research.  The sell side analyst try to generate trades for the customers of the company that they work for, and thus tend to find "the new new thing," but almost all of them have a decent financial model and help explain what is happening for areas you may want to invest in.


There are a variety of ways that an individual can get this information:

### Sell Side Option 1 Sell Side-$$$:  Get a seat or terminal**

Both Bloomberg and Thompson through Refinitiv Eikon has access to some, but not all, reports.  Costs will be somewhere around $20-30K per year, and has other financial information on their platform.  Some university will offer access to their business or economic students.

Eikon has  transcripts that are real time, and is useful if you listen to a phone call as you can read the call almost immediately.  You can download transcripts in a variety of formats.

### Sell Side Option 2-$:  Have multiple accounts for individual sell side reports**

#### Wells Fargo Advisors Account:

After login "Research -> News/Research -> Go to bottom and click on "View all Wells Fargo Securities Research"

#### eTrade to get Morgan Stanley Research

Bring up any stock, go to "Analyst Research" scroll down to Fundamental sub-head, and look for Morgan Stanley.  Click on "additional reports" to bring up all Morgan Stanley Reseach on the stock.

#### Merill Lynch to get Bank of America Research

Click on research tab and go to "BoA Global Research."  I like to click on "Advanced search" blue text to allow more sorting and searching.

#### Chase Brokerage to get JP Morgan

Bring up any stock.  Scroll down to Analyst Rating.  Click on "Explore More JP Morgan Research".

#### Interactive Broker to get Evercore ISI

BREAKS MY HEART, BUT THEY STOPPED THEIR RELATIONSHIP

Go to Research -> News & Research > Advanced Search and filter on Evercore.  Does not carry history, so you will need to pull down reports at least monthly

With that written, IB still carries Refinitiv transcripts and summaries, which are excellent.

```Search
Refinitiv Briefs
```

Note comes up as Reuters Brief in search box.  So you can put this in instead.

Also

```Search
Refinitiv Transcripts
```


#### Stifel

Sign up for their Wealth Tracker @ https://www.stifel.com/tracker

You can now access their sell side reports

#### Fidelity

While it has some research, it is mainly turn the crank web scrapping research.  Many doubles with list above.  Right now Fidelity does not offer a lot of value in intelligent research, unlike the above.

### Streaming Video Services

CNBC can be accessed through Charles Schwab "ThinkorSwim" platform.  Install the app and go to "Trader TV"  A benefit of the platform is that it trims the ads out of the video flow.

Schwab Network can be accessed through Charles Schwab "ThinkorSwim" platform.  Install the app and go to "Trader TV"

Bloomberg TV can be access through the eTrade app or PlutoTV app.  Similar to Thinkorswim for CNBC, they cut the advertisements.

Yahoo Finance Also Offers a video stream similar to the above

### Podcasts

Aquired:  Must listen to Podcast, and offers transcripts, which is critical for AI processing.

Lex Fridman

I will put this here, although controversial.  However, his podcast on deepseek was incredibly insightful.  He tends to interview certain leaders.  He also offers transcripts, which is critical for AI processing.

Speaking of transcripts, check out https://app.podscribe.ai/. You can see all of the Money Podcasts, like from CNBC, and the transcripts are generated.  This allows you to search and feed the podcast to a LLM for processing.

**Other Financial Resources**

Seekingalpha is for small home grown analysts.  They were traditionally one of the first non-Thompson resources to offer transcripts, which I always considered value-add.  Getting full access will be somewhere around $240 per year.

Yahoo Finance will also carry transcripts with sometimes being external links.

Bloomberg often has a lot of eye catching news.  Getting access will be around $180 per year.

**PodCasts:**

CNBC has a variety of Podcast that wrap up their video feeds.  Search on CNBC on your podcast app

Acquired digs into companies in depth and provides historical context.  Highly recommended.

Freakonomic podcast is about thinking through economic issues in new ways.  This is not directly stock related, but may allow you to think through why things happen economically.

**Reading SEC Reports:**

You need to read the 10K and the 10Q for each company that you invest in.  If you cannot do this, then there is no sense in investing in a company.  Reading these reports is like checking the oil in your car.  It is regular maintanence work.

[capedge.com](http://capedge.com) is the best site to use since it has a differential function that shows you the docs with any changes marked up version to version.  It is a brilliant feature.  The website does require a free login.

[novusvalue.com](http://novusvalue.com) is an app set up by an indepent developer.  I think it has a better reading experience, but the diff function on capedge makes it more compelling.  However, the dev of this app seems to be open to upgrades, so watch his space for changes.
