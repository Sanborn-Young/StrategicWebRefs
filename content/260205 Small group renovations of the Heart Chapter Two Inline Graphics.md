x`#### Problem Statement:  Dallas Willard creates a structure which has many thoughtful and good ideas but he does a poor job of Integrating classic Christian thoughts Into its frameworks.  

In chapter two of his book, Willard uses the Shema (as quoted by Jesus in Luke 10:25‑28) as the structural center of his whole argument about what a human being is and what spiritual formation must aim at.  He then creates a system that is a framework where he takes various sections of scripture but does not clearly and carefully build from what the scripture actually says. So his system is useful, but it fundamentally lacks rigor in extracting an understanding from Scripture, thus suffers deficits.  

In essence, Willard's structure is listed below where the soul is the integrator of all the parts. This is a novel explanation that should be understood utilizes a different framework or reuses words that diverges from the traditional understanding of what a soul is.  This is not to suggest that we need to abandon Willard, but only that we must have some base assumption before we look at variations.

So now let's ask ourselves, what is the framework by which the early church and other theologians down through the ages have understood how we should think about the integration of body and spirit?
#### Genesis as the foundation model for our creation

Genesis lays out in clear and unambiguous terms how man was created. So we need to take a look at this as our base level of understanding about the architecture of humans.

> “Then the Lord God formed the man of the dust ([עָפָר aphar](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6083.htm)) from the ground ([אֲדָמָה adamah](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/127.htm)) and breathed the breath ([נִשְׁמַת neshamah](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5397.htm)) of life ([חַיִּים chayyim](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/2416.htm)) into his nostrils, and the man became a living being ([נֶפֶשׁ nephesh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5315.htm)).” 
> 
> ***— Genesis 2:7***

##### Narrative explanation

Dust and ground are tightly coupled together, so you should think as clearly speaking to the same substance. 

However breath and life in the Old Testament are clearly separate concepts, and although it is God's breath that carries life, they are two ideas that are not from the same root or concept.

In this verse, Genesis presents humanity as coming into existence through two coordinated acts. First, God forms a physical body from “dust” (*aphar*) taken from the “ground” (*adamah*), highlighting that our bodily nature is material, earthly, and creaturely. Secondly, God personally breathes into that formed dirt his “breath” (*neshamah*) of “life” (*chayyim*), so that the man becomes a living *nephesh*, a living person.

Although this is clearly anthropomorphized, it is also deeply rich symbolism: the very essence of what is inside of God, his breath which clearly signifies the aspect of who he is, carries his power when it is placed into dirt, so much so that a unique being is created and thus we get the story of Adam and Eve.

This pattern allows us to speak of two aspects or “parts” of man without separating them into independent entities. The *aphar/adamah* language stresses the bodily, physical aspect, while the *neshamah/chayyim* language points to the God-given life-principle that animates that body. When these come together, the result is not just a body plus something added, but a unified living being (*nephesh*), an embodied soul whose life and breath are derived from God Himself.

#### Dichotomy versus Trichotomy perception of man

Interpretation of God's act of creation becomes problematic when we ask ourselves when God breathed into the dust what structures were created?  Taken at face value the Genesis account clearly indicates that there's only two parts:  dirt and breath. However as we take a look at the entirety of Scripture other terminologies and other ideas may emerge.  Scripture has talked about the body, the spirit, and the soul.

This has turned into a debate which is commonly called dichotomy versus trichotomy in the creation of mankind, and debated since early in the Christian church. 

See table below for how this expresses itself in the Church's creeds or confessions or teachers.

**Chuck Smith quote (trichotomy)**

> “But because God, you see is a superior Trinity, Father, Son and Spirit. I am an inferior Trinity, spirit, soul and body. I meet God in the realm of the spirit.”  
> — Chuck Smith, cited in [Trichotomy – Calvary Chapel Wiki](http://calvarychapel.pbworks.com/w/page/13146689/trichotomy) and discussed in [Trichotomy – Modern Reformation](https://www.modernreformation.org/resources/articles/trichotomy).

I would suggest that Chuck Smith has verbalized what is highly attractive to people who think about the Godhead as the Trinity. If his very nature, is one substance with three beings, maybe I somehow should be three things inside of one person.

##### Trichotomy and Dichotomy Side by Side

The table below lays out how both views regard the body much the same. 

It is the Trichotomy viewpoint that further separates soul and spirit into two different parts.  The definitions of the body are in the second and third column, meanwhile, the non-body parts are laid out in the last three columns.  

| Elements      | Trichotomy: Body                     | Dichotomy: Body                       | Trichotomy: Soul                          | Trichotomy: Spirit                                  | Dichotomy: Soul/Spirit (one immaterial part)                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consciousness | World-consciousness (through senses) | World-consciousness                   | Self-consciousness (aware of “me”)        | God-consciousness (aware of God)                    | Self- and God-consciousness together                           |
| Processing    | Organism (11 systems)                | Organism (11 systems)                 | Intellect (analysis, reasoning, planning) | Intuition (spiritual discernment)                   | Intellect and intuition (reasoning and spiritual discernment)  |
| Reaction      | Instinct (survival responses)        | Instinct (survival responses)         | Emotion (fear, joy, anger, etc.)          | Conscience (moral awareness of good/evil)           | Emotion and conscience (feelings and moral awareness together) |
| Action        | Drive (hunger, thirst, sex, etc.)    | Drive (bodily appetites and impulses) | Volition (choosing, resolving, deciding)  | Communion (love and fellowship with God and others) | Volition and communion (choices and relational love)           |
| Life          | Biological life (bios)               | Biological life (bios)                | Psychological life (psuche – soul-life)   | Spiritual life (zoe – life from God)                | Inner life as one whole (psuche and zoe viewed inseparably)    |

The following table now lays two more structures which are spoken about in Scripture. The mind and the heart overlay and both reside in the spirit and inside of the soul in this framework. The table over states how much the mind and heart exclusively lays inside the soul. In this particular model, these separate spiritual part influences the when you are with God, and the influence of the Spirit on the soul then also shapes our heart and our mind.

| Basic definition       | The inner, immaterial self; the seat of personality and “I am,” containing both mind and heart as its main faculties.                                                         | The rational faculty **within the soul** that thinks, reasons, and interprets life; this same mind can run on merely natural assumptions (soul operating on its own) or be illuminated and directed by the spirit’s light and truth (soul under spirit).        | The affective–volitional center **within the soul** where desires, loves, and core commitments reside; these same loves can be self-centered (soul acting independently) or reoriented by the spirit toward God and neighbor (soul aligned with spirit).          | The God-aware, God-responsive core of a person, designed for worship, fellowship, and reception of God’s life.            |
| Main role              | Holds together thoughts, emotions, and will as a unified inner person that can either resist or cooperate with the spirit.                                                    | Processes beliefs, interpretations, and plans as the “control room” of the soul; when the spirit is ignored, the mind leans on human wisdom, but when the spirit is heeded, the mind becomes a channel for spiritual discernment and “mind of Christ” thinking. | Steers what the person treasures, chooses, and clings to at a deep level; without the spirit’s influence the heart defaults to disordered loves, but under the spirit’s work the same heart becomes the place where new priorities and holy affections take root. | Brings God-consciousness, revelation, and power that penetrate and transform the soul’s mind and heart.                   |
| Relation to trichotomy | One of the three “parts” (body–soul–spirit), representing the whole psychological and relational self that is shaped from above by the spirit and expressed through the body. | A faculty **inside the soul**, not a separate part; it is the interface where the spirit’s insight translates into new thoughts, renewed perspectives, and spiritually informed judgments within the soul’s ordinary cognitive processes.                       | A faculty **inside the soul**, not a separate part; it is the interface where the spirit’s presence translates into new desires, reordered loves, and deeper loyalty to God within the soul’s ordinary emotional and volitional life.                             | A distinct immaterial part that interfaces with God and then influences the soul (mind, heart) and, through it, the body. |
| Relation to spirit     | The soul as a whole is progressively reshaped as the spirit, enlivened by God, works its life and insight into both mind and heart.                                           | The spirit enlightens and renews the mind by feeding it truth, convicting error, and giving spiritual understanding, so the same soul-mind begins to think God’s thoughts after Him rather than merely reflecting natural or cultural patterns.                 | The spirit softens and redirects the heart by exposing false loves, healing wounds, and pouring in God’s love, so the same soul-heart learns to desire God’s will, delight in what is good, and choose sacrificial love.                                          | Receives, hosts, and transmits God’s life, truth, and love into the soul’s mind and heart, and out into behavior.         |
#### Trichotomy Diagram

While trichotomy as an overlap of mind body and spirit has been utilized for centuries there are no clean definitions of how exactly to think of everything. However there is clear overlap between all of the different areas.

#### Scriptural references

While citing Genesis is clear and unequivocal in terms of the value it brings to this discussion, other sections of the Old Testament are less so. This is especially true when thinking about the idea that God has aggressively revealed himself to us. Considering that the nature of the triune god was not visible in the Old Testament and not understood by any Jewish rabbis, we should assume that for For the finer theological points of the construction of the body, we should more heavily rely upon new testament sources.  Once we understand the nature of the New Testament, we can then go back and verify if the Old Testament appears to make these assumptions invalid and somehow contradict. We will not discuss it rigorously here, because the Old Testament does not conflict with a Trichonomy or Dichonomy view of mankind.

#### The Gospels

Both schools will argue that the text from the Gospels could support their contention. However, when we try to do exegesis from the Scripture, we should first ask ourselves what is the normative usage of something? And then ask ourselves if there is not a normative usage of the item, does this somehow overthrow the normative usage? And if it does overthrow it, is it clear in terms of how it reinterprets the normative.

In this instance, it is clear that dichotomy is the normal usage of how mankind is put together. And while there may be a trichonomy flavor, it's difficult to say that this clearly is placed in to help us understand why the dichotomy references are wrong.

Many commentators reply that Hebrew‑style parallelism is in view: “soul” and “spirit” are poetic near‑synonyms for the same inner self praising God, which better supports **dichotomy/holistic** anthropology than a rigid three‑part scheme.                                  |

That which is born of the **flesh** is flesh, and that which is born of the **Spirit** is spirit.” | Echoed later by Paul, this passage sets **flesh** against **Spirit** as two orders of life, not as two compartments alongside “soul.” It is therefore typically read as fitting a **dichotomous** (or even more simply, “old vs. new life”) framework: one person can live in the flesh or in the Spirit.                                                           |

No separate “spirit” is mentioned here, so this verse is usually taken as neutral but compatible with **dichotomy** (body plus inner self) rather than as evidence for a three‑part division.                                                                                                         |

Interpreters generally see this as supporting a practical **dichotomy** (inner willing vs. bodily weakness) rather than trichotomy.                                                                           |

#### Pauline writings

Paul's central role in sight of the Church was to create a formalized theology around the general narrative of the gospel. His first text listed below is often cited as to support trichotomy. However similar to the Gospels Paul does not support consistent usage of all these terms together. Undoubtedly the overall weight of his writings would clearly indicate dichotomy as a mainstream view, with him specifically talking about the war between the body and the flesh and the spirit.   In this light, it clearly would indicate that the normative way of thinking about this is dichotomy.

| 1 Thessalonians 5:23        | “May your whole **spirit and soul and body** be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”                                                                                                                                      | Classic **trichotomy** proof‑text: three terms listed together. Dichotomists answer that Paul is piling up near‑synonyms (like “heart, soul, mind, strength”) as a way of saying “your whole person,” not giving a parts‑list.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1 Corinthians 14:14–15      | “If I pray in a tongue, my **spirit** prays but my **mind** is unfruitful… I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also.”                                                                                                   | Trichotomists sometimes cite this as showing a human spirit distinct from the mind/soul. Dichotomists argue Paul is distinguishing modes of activity within one inner life (non‑cognitive vs. cognitive) rather than separate “parts,” so it fits **dichotomy** better.                                                                                                         |
| 1 Corinthians 2:14–3:1      | “The **natural [psychikos] person** does not accept the things of the Spirit of God… But the **spiritual [pneumatikos] person** judges all things… I… could not address you as spiritual people, but as **people of the flesh [sarkinos]**.” | Some trichotomists see three categories (soulish, spiritual, fleshly) hinting at body–soul–spirit. Many commentators respond that Paul is contrasting life ruled by the Spirit versus life ruled by the “flesh,” and “psychikos” means ordinary, earthly life, not a third substantial part; this supports a **functional dichotomy** (outer vs. inner under different powers). |
| Romans 8:4–13               | “…those who live according to the **flesh** set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the **Spirit** set their minds on the things of the Spirit.”                                                         | Central for **dichotomy**: “flesh” and “Spirit” are two spheres or powers under which the one human self can live, not two compartments alongside “soul.” Paul’s focus is old‑age vs. new‑age existence, not three‑part psychology.                                                                                                                                             |
| Galatians 5:16–25           | “Walk by the **Spirit**, and you will not gratify the desires of the **flesh**. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit…”                                                                                                        | Again supports **dichotomy** in practice: Paul contrasts two masters (flesh vs. Spirit) contending for the same heart and body, not three components. The “works of the flesh” and “fruit of the Spirit” describe moral orientation of the whole person.                                                                                                                        |
| 2 Corinthians 4:16–5:4      | “Though our **outer self** is wasting away, our **inner self** is being renewed day by day… For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling.”                                                                             | Frequently cited for **dichotomy**: Paul gives a twofold schema—outer vs. inner person—rather than body–soul–spirit. The inner person (heart, mind, spirit) is one reality that will eventually be clothed with a renewed body.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Philippians 1:20–24         | “…it is my eager expectation… that Christ will be honored in my **body**, whether by life or by death… My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.”                                                                   | Used for **dichotomy**: Paul can imagine himself existing “with Christ” apart from the present body, which suggests a basic two‑element view (body and an immaterial self) rather than three separable immaterial parts.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 Corinthians 15:42–49      | “It is sown a **natural [psychikos] body**; it is raised a **spiritual [pneumatikos] body**… The first man Adam became a living **soul [psychē]**; the last Adam became a life‑giving **spirit [pneuma]**.”                                  | Trichotomists sometimes see body–soul–spirit terminology here. But many Pauline specialists argue that “psychikos” vs. “pneumatikos” describes what *animates* the body (present life vs. Spirit‑given life), not its number of parts, so the passage supports an integrated, essentially **dichotomous** view.                                                                 |
| Ephesians 4:22–24           | “…put off your old self… and be renewed in the **spirit of your minds**, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God…”                                                                                                        | Paul stacks “spirit” and “mind” language but uses it to describe one renewed inner person. Interpreters therefore treat this as **dichotomy** language: one inner self being transformed, not separate soul and spirit layers.                                                                                                                                                  |

#### The Rest of The New Testament

In the rest of the New Testament, We get various authors often prized for new and insightful angles on things that helps illuminate the other sections of the New Testament. However in this case, the writings seem extremely similar to the other SE, with dichotomy on top of dimensions with no consistent trichotomy mentions in these other writings. There certainly is no clear explanation of a triality of how mankind was put together.

| Reference (non‑Gospel, non‑Pauline NT) | Text (ESV excerpt, shortened) | How it is usually taken in the debate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hebrews 4:12 | “The word of God… piercing to the division of **soul and of spirit**, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” | One of the main **trichotomy** proof‑texts: explicitly mentions “soul and spirit” as if separable. Dichotomists counter that the pairing is like “joints and marrow, thoughts and intentions”—a rhetorical way of saying God’s word reaches to the deepest recesses of the one inner person, so it need not imply two different immaterial substances. |
| James 2:26 | “For as the **body** apart from the **spirit** is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.” | Standard **dichotomy** text: life is body + spirit together; death is their separation. “Soul” is not added as a third term, so the verse naturally reads as body vs. spirit/inner life. |
| 1 Peter 1:8–9 | “…you believe in him and rejoice… obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your **souls**.” | Often used broadly for **dichotomy/holistic dualism**: “souls” here stands for the whole inner life/person that is saved. It does not set soul over against spirit, so it is neutral for strict trichotomy but fits easily with a two‑part (body and inner person) view. |
| 1 Peter 3:18–19 | “…put to death in the **flesh** but made alive in the **spirit**, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison.” | Sometimes drawn into the discussion as showing Jesus’ human existence in flesh vs. in spirit. Most interpreters take this as **dichotomous/functional** (earthly bodily life vs. resurrection/Spirit sphere) rather than a map of three human parts. |
| Revelation 6:9 | “I saw under the altar the **souls** of those who had been slain for the word of God…” | Used for **dichotomy**: disembodied “souls” consciously exist apart from their bodies, indicating at least two distinguishable elements (body and an immaterial self). The text does not distinguish soul from spirit, so it does not directly support trichotomy. |
| Revelation 20:4 | “I saw the **souls** of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus… They came to life and reigned with Christ…” | Similar to Revelation 6:9, this is taken to support **dichotomy**: “souls” represent the conscious inner persons awaiting bodily resurrection. Again, no separate “spirit” term is used. |

#### The primacy of the Shema

Willard utilizes the Shema to introduce his framework.

The Shema very important but should not be used simply as a stopover point in the creation of a framework. In that sense the shema is one of the most central concepts in doctrines inside of the New Testament and is not only regarded as the most important commandment but the Shema, with the exhortation of how to treat your neighbor, is the totality of the Old Testament.  At the highest level the along with Christ exhortation about loving your neighbor should be thought of as we are commanded to love and that love means that you will reach out to your neighbor. 

In the first chapter of his book Willard emphasizes that it's all about the heart. He loops back to this multiple times, and he sets a narrative of the heart against social structure and he wraps it into a narrative of spirituality. In essence, he highlights that there is true spirituality and there is false spirituality. While this certainly is true and he brings up many valid points, we want to keep our eye on the point that he's fundamentally calling attention to spirituality and heart and then using the Shema to introduce an extended framework on this. In reality, before we hijack scripture to then try to prove our own point, we want to take scripture on its own ground and ask ourselves, what does that scripture speak to us about? this is allowing us to allow scripture to shape us rather than finding points in scripture to try to construct a narrative that is of our own making.

To be clear, the Shamah is not about fixing your mind and to interpret and use this to support a narrative is to put the cart before the horse. The Shamah emphasizes one thing and one thing only. That is everything in this life is to be centered around the love of God. To do this, we need to ask ourselves how we are to love God. And thus the Shema is careful in the way that it helps us think through the multiple avenues of how we're put together so that we can express this love in the best fashion. more than that, Christ then emphasizes that if this love is only expressed toward the Godhead, it is not true love, and therefore the practical application of the Shema cannot simply stop with a filled good, I've done the right thing toward the Godhead, but must express itself in terms of our love toward our neighbor.

In other words, the fundamental problem that we have is not understanding how to love. And once we understand how to love, then everything else snaps into line. This allows us to place the horse in front of the cart and we recognize what poses through is this fundamental understanding of love, not an understanding of spirituality and heart. That's not to say the rest of this framework will not be important for us to think through things. But in as much as any of this framework doesn't directly lead us to think about love, we short circuit what scripture is trying to tell us as it points us to logos.

This formal of love at the core of our theology finds its crescendo in the 13th chapter of First Corinthians. This is where Paul informs us that:

> 8 **Love never fails.** But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
> 
> 13 **And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.**

**The New Testament again is all about love and it is God reaching out to His creation to reconcile it to himself.**

Progressive revelation teaches that God unfolds his truth gradually across Scripture, from partial glimpses in the Old Testament to fuller clarity in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, God demonstrates his character through mighty deeds, delivering Israel from Egypt, upholding covenants, and showing hesed ([חֶסֶד](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/2617.htm)) amid judgment, as in [Exodus 34:6–7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A6-7&version=ESV). These acts reveal attributes like power (parting the Red Sea), strength (sustaining the nation), and faithfulness (keeping promises to Abraham), yet the full meaning often remained shadowed until Christ.

Jesus and the apostles retrospectively illuminate these acts, the Passover lamb foreshadows Christ's sacrifice, and God's hesed ([חֶסֶד](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/2617.htm)) toward rebellious Israel previews the cross. The New Testament provides the "fuller picture," where Old Testament events gain ultimate significance through the incarnation, death, and resurrection. While the Greek word agape ([ἀγάπη](http://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)) (unconditional, self-giving love, one of the four biblical loves, alongside storge, philia, and eros) is absent from the Hebrew Old Testament, its essence permeates hesed ([חֶסֶד](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/2617.htm)) and ahavah ([אַהֲבָה](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/160.htm)).

God never explicitly says "I am love" (agape, [ἀγάπη](http://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)) in the Old Testament, but [1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8&version=ESV) declares "God is love" (ho theos agapē estin), uniquely identifying agape ([ἀγάπη](http://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)) as intrinsic to his being, revealed supremely when God sends his Son. Thus, the Old Testament shows God's power and steadfastness in action, the New Testament unveils that at his core, he is agape ([ἀγάπη](http://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)), eternally loving and unchanging.

In the New Testament quotations of the Shema, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart…” in [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37&version=ESV), [Mark 12:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A30&version=ESV), and [Luke 10:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A27&version=ESV), the commanded “love” is the verb agapeseis ([ἀγαπήσεις](http://biblehub.com/greek/25.htm)), from agapao ([ἀγαπάω](http://biblehub.com/greek/25.htm)), making the central, focal love of the Shema explicitly a love of the agape ([ἀγάπη](http://biblehub.com/greek/26.htm)) kind.

#### More thoughts on the adequacy and rationale:  Why the New Testament had to be written in Greek. 

And specifically how Greek is part of God's plan in revealing the scripture to us.

***Most modern translators assume the Septuagint is a bug, I consider it a feature.***

Having an understanding of the principle of progressive revelation is critical when reading the scriptures.  We need to understand that we can only understand what the Old Testament says through the lens of progressive revelation that came in through the New Testament.  There have been some that have argued that you look both at the Greek in the New Testament and the Hebrew in the Old Testament and you allow the Hebrew to be more authoritative because the New Testament writers were clearly quoting the Septuagint. I believe this is incorrect, in that the Septuagint was part of God progressively revealing his true nature to us. So the Septuagint serves as a commentary to the original Hebrew to explain how we should think about the terminology in the Old Testament.

#### Shema

Jesus explicitly quotes the Shema as the “greatest commandment”, adding “mind” in Greek: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind/strength.” He then joins it with “love your neighbor as yourself,” saying “on these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”

Thus we both the early Church fathers and the Saints through the ages referring to this.

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Jesus (Synoptic Gospels) | Quotes the Shema as the **greatest commandment**, explicitly naming heart, soul, mind (and strength in Mark/Luke), calling for total‑person love of God. | Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:29–30; Luke 10:27 | [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) • [Matthew 22:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37&version=ESV) • [Mark 12:29–30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A29-30&version=ESV) • [Luke 10:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A27&version=ESV) |
| Paul (whole‑person language) | Does not repeat the exact fourfold formula, but echoes the Shema and speaks of presenting bodies to God and being renewed in mind—effectively whole‑person love and service. | Romans 12:1–2; 1 Corinthians 8:4–6 | [Paul the Apostle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle) • [Romans 12:1–2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A1-2&version=ESV) • [1 Corinthians 8:4–6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+8%3A4-6&version=ESV) |
| Origen (early Father) | In homilies and commentaries on the Law and Gospels, expounds the greatest commandment as loving God with **every faculty** of the soul and body (heart, mind, life, actions), though he often paraphrases rather than listing all four Greek terms. | Homilies on Law and Gospels | [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen) • Works: [NewAdvent Origen collection](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/) |
| Augustine of Hippo   | Preaches on the greatest commandment (Matt 22; Mark 12) as the **summary of Christian life**, explaining that “heart, soul, mind, strength” together mean that nothing in us is to be withheld from love for God. | Sermons on Matthew 22 / Mark 12 | [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) • Sermons: [NewAdvent Augustine sermons index](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1603.htm) |
| Thomas Aquinas       | In *Summa Theologiae*, treats the command to love God with all one’s heart, soul, mind, and strength as the **chief precept of charity**, unpacking each term as a way all powers of the soul are ordered to God. | Summa Theologiae II–II, q.44 | [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) • [Summa II–II q.44](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3044.htm) |
| John Calvin          | In commentaries (Deut 6; Matt 22; Mark 12), explains that heart, soul, mind, strength are overlapping expressions that show **the whole man**—affections, understanding, will, and bodily powers—belongs to God. | Commentaries on Deut 6:5; Matt 22:37; Mark 12:30 | [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin) • Calvin’s Commentaries: [CCEL Calvin set](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin) |
| John Wesley          | Defines real Christianity as loving God “with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his mind, and with all his strength”; says a Methodist is one who does this, presenting **soul and body as a living sacrifice** and directing every thought, word, work, and power to God’s glory. | *A Plain Account of Christian Perfection*; Sermon 92 “On Zeal” | [John Wesley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley) • *Plain Account*: [World Invisible](https://www.worldinvisible.com/library/wesley/8317/831701.htm) • Sermons: [Wesley Center](https://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-sermons-of-john-wesley-1872-edition/) |
| Oswald Chambers      | Treats “love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength” as a **holy command** that defines true devotion. Emphasizes that such love is impossible in human strength and must be produced by God’s love in us; uses the greatest commandment to frame missionary consecration and daily obedience. | Devotional pieces such as “A Holy Command” and “The Key to the Missionary’s Devotion,” which expound Mark 12:30–31 | [Oswald Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Chambers) • Devotional on the great commandment: [“A Holy Command”](https://ourdailybreadpublishing.org/holy-command) • General devotional context: [My Utmost for His Highest](https://utmost.org/) |

If we look at the table above we can see that strength is mentioned in two out of the 3 times. 

In classical Bible discourse, it is believes the each had their own audience and things to go and drive, and thus shaped their message to that end.  In this light, Matthew sets up the discourse at generating "insight" and makes the call from the insight at the end of the gospel.

He sought indicate how the Hebrews should understand Jesus, the Law, and the Kingdom.  Action is indicated at the end by the most famous version of "The Great Commission."  Historically Matthew was considered as a gospel to the Hebrews of the time. In this light they would have known the shema and would not need to have strength incorporated since it would be something that would repeat on a daily basis as part of their pious understanding of how to be a Hebrew.  In Hebrew, strength is "might" and reference is lower in this document. |

Worried about historical accuracy and tries to make sure that this a correct compilation so would want to make sure to immediately wrap in comments about "strength" if he felt that it was actually said during the conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Matthew's lack of using in the course, thereby does not diminish **Strength**, and therefore we will make a careful examination of the the word strength.
##### Lexical Meaning

Ἰσχύς (ischus, Strong's [G2479](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2479/kjv/tr/0-1/)) denotes “forcefulness” literally or figuratively, rooted in the idea of force (from a derivative of ἱς / is, “force”), and is glossed as ability, might, power, strength in standard lexicons such as Thayer and Strong (see the [StudyLight](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2479.html) Greek lexicon entry for ἰσχύς and the lexical summary at [LaParola](https://www.laparola.net/greco/parola.php?p=%E1%BC%B0%CF%83%CF%87%E1%BD%BB%CF%82)). Classical and historical lexica trace it to the idea of strength or physical might generally, not merely activity, as reflected in discussions of its etymology and usage (for example, the entry on ἰσχύς at [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%B0%CF%83%CF%87%CF%8D%CF%82)).

##### Biblical Usage
In the New Testament, ἰσχύς appears ten or eleven times (depending on the text tradition), applied variously to God’s might, angelic strength, or human capacity. For example, heavenly praise ascribes “strength” alongside other attributes to the Lamb in [Revelation 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+5%3A12&version=NIV) and to God in the doxology of [Revelation 7:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+7%3A12&version=NIV). Angelic beings are described as greater in “power and might” in [2 Peter 2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A11&version=NIV). The term is also used in relation to God’s power toward believers in [Ephesians 1:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A19&version=NIV) and exhortations to “be strong in the Lord” in [Ephesians 6:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A10&version=NIV), as well as in the call to serve “with the strength God provides” in [1 Peter 4:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A11&version=NIV). In the context of judgment, it appears in connection with “the glory of His power” in [2 Thessalonians 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+1%3A9&version=NIV). Other occurrences, such as in the command to love God “with all your strength” in [Mark 12:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A30&version=NIV), its restatement in [Mark 12:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12%3A33&version=NIV), and the parallel wording in [Luke 10:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A27&version=NIV), show that this term often points to spiritual or God-enabled capacity expressed through the whole person rather than overt bodily exertion alone.

##### The contemporary use of this word in Greek literature that may allow us to get a fuller understanding of the New Testament
Classical Greek usage includes the notion of physical or martial strength (e.g., the strength of warriors, robustness of body), and cognate verb forms like ἰσχύω can mean “to be strong in body, robust, in sound health” (see [StudyLight](https://studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2480.html) on ἰσχύω). However, New Testament contexts characteristically frame ἰσχύς as the whole-person capacity or might that underlies action—divine, angelic, or human—rather than as primarily, or narrowly, physical activity.

#### Why is this different From Hebrew to Greek?
##### 1. Hebrew categories are broader and overlapping

Deuteronomy 6:5 uses three Hebrew terms: **heart (levav)**, **soul (nephesh)**, and **might/strength (meod)**.  
- *Levav* already covers what we call **heart + mind** (thinking, willing, feeling), since Hebrew doesn’t sharply separate “heart” from “mind.”  
- *Nephesh* is “life, self, person,” not a thin “soul” slice; it can include the whole living being.  
- *Meod* literally “muchness,” often used as “very,” “exceedingly,” came to mean **all your capacity/strength/resources**.  

Thus the OT Shema already aims at **all that you are**, not three neat compartments.

##### 2. Translation and expansion in Greek

When the Shema moves into Greek and then into the Synoptic quotations, several things happen:
- Hebrew terms don’t have exact Greek equivalents. *Levav* can be rendered by **kardia** (heart) or **nous/dianoia** (mind), and *nephesh* by **psyche** (soul/life), with overlaps among them.  
- “heart, soul, mind, strength” as **double or expanded translations** of the same Hebrew ideas
- Deuteronomy’s “might” (*meod*) can be unpacked in Greek by emphasizing both **mind** and **strength**, capturing “all your capacity” in mental and physical terms for Greek‑speaking audiences.  

Thus Jesus was explaining what the Hebrew meant in Koine Greek.

#### Bridging to the Dallas Willard Book

Willard attempts to build upon the base of understanding that we have more than just a body however his particular framework needs to be understood in terms of an overall framework which has been discussed for many years So it important to think crisply about your view of exactly what underlies his framework.

#### Comparison to other frameworks

|View / theologians|Basic structure of the person|How it relates to Willard’s six aspects|Key strengths / cautions (re: “tri-part” vs not)|
|-|-|-|-|
|[Strict trichotomy](https://www.gotquestions.org/dichotomy-trichotomy.html)|Three parts: body, soul, spirit as distinct components.|Would tend to treat “spirit” and “soul” as separate layers, not just different aspects of one inner life.|Strength: highlights God‑oriented “spirit.” Caution: forces sharper distinctions than biblical word-usage clearly supports.|
|[Classic dichotomy](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/body-and-soul)|Two parts: body and soul/spirit (inner and outer).|Close to Willard: one embodied person with a single inner life (thought, feeling, will, etc.) functioning through the body.|Strength: preserves unity and simplicity. Caution: may under-describe the different functional dimensions Willard highlights.|
|[Willard’s functional model](https://dwillard.org/resources/articles/spiritual-formation-what-it-is-and-how-it-is-done)|One unified person, described in six aspects (thought, feeling, choice/heart/spirit, body, social context, soul as integrator).|Not tri-part in substance; uses overlapping biblical terms to name functional domains for spiritual formation.|Strength: very usable for formation; honors biblical overlap in terms. Caution: can be mistaken for a rigid map if tied too tightly to specific Hebrew/Greek words.|
|[N. T. Wright (holistic)](https://ntwrightpage.com/2016/07/12/mind-spirit-soul-and-body/)|One holistic human being; “body, soul, spirit, mind” are overlapping descriptors, not fixed parts.|Very close in instinct: emphasizes whole-person transformation, wary of hard part-lists.|Strength: tracks the fluid biblical usage closely. Caution: gives less fine-grained internal “map” than Willard’s sixfold scheme.|
|[Karl Barth (body–soul, Spirit as God)](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/barth/The_Humanity_of_God_-_Karl_Barth.pdf)|One person as “soul of my body”; Spirit is primarily the Holy Spirit, not a third human part.|Resonates with Willard’s insistence on unity; less interested in parsing inner functions into several aspects.|Strength: strongly resists speculative part-counting; centers God’s action. Caution: offers fewer psychological categories for targeted formation practices.|

##### Here is a concise, word‑study–driven layout of why some argue for trichotomy (body–soul–spirit) versus dichotomy (body + soul/spirit), using OT/NT vocabulary.

##### 1\. Trichotomy: biblical and lexical case

Trichotomists say Scripture distinguishes body, soul, and spirit as three components.

###### Key NT texts

* 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “spirit and soul and body”
  * Argument: Paul intentionally lists three items as distinct; if he meant only “inner and outer,” he could have used two. See [GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/body-soul-spirit.html).
* Hebrews 4:12 – “dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow, thoughts and intentions”
  * Argument: God’s word can distinguish between ψυχή (*psyche*, soul) and πνεῦμα (*pneuma*, spirit), implying a real difference, not pure synonymy. See [GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/trichotomy-dichotomy.html).

###### Word-study points used for trichotomy

* ψυχή (*psyche*) – soul, life, self; often used for a person’s life in relation to the world (e.g., “whoever loses his life/soul will find it,” Matthew 16:26). See [ChristoPress](https://www.christopress.com/trichotomy-vs-dichotomy-the-biblical-and-theological-survey-of-mans-composition-2/).
* πνεῦμα (*pneuma*) – spirit; in humans, the God‑ward, God‑originated aspect of inner life (e.g., 1 Corinthians 2:11; Romans 8:16). See [BiblicalPsychology](https://biblicalpsychology.net/2026/01/08/trichotomy-biblical-study/).

Paralleled in Hebrew:

* נֶפֶשׁ (*nephesh*) – “soul, life, person,” often the whole living being (Genesis 2:7; Ezekiel 18:4), including animals. See [BibleHub on nephesh](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5315.htm).
* רוּחַ (*ruach*) – “spirit, wind, breath,” not used for the whole person and usually reserved for God or the God‑oriented aspect in humans. See [BibleHub on ruach](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/7307.htm).

Trichotomists infer:

* *Nephesh / psyche* = “self, life, individual person” in the world.
* *Ruach / pneuma* = “spirit” as a higher, God‑ward faculty, capable of communion with God.
* Thus, man is body (σῶμα / *basar*), soul (ψυχή / *nephesh*), and spirit (πνεῦμα / *ruach*). See [Christian News Missouri](https://christiannewsmissouri.com/2024/08/28/trichotomy-or-dichotomy-some-considerations/).

|Body|HE [בָּשָׂר (*basar*)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1320.htm); GR [σῶμα (*sōma*)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4983.htm); GR [σάρξ (*sarx*)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4561.htm)|Physical, world‑facing part|Biological life, brain and nervous system, senses, movement, “strength,” physical habits and actions in the visible world|Outward instrument that expresses what soul and spirit direct; lowest level (world‑contact)|
|Soul|HE [נֶפֶשׁ (*nephesh*)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5315.htm); GR [ψυχή (*psyche*)](https://biblehub.com/greek/5590.htm); HE [לֵב (*lev*, heart)](https://www.preceptaustin.org/heart_leb); GR [ψυχικός (*psychikos*, “soulish”)](https://biblehub.com/greek/5591.htm)|Psychological, self‑facing part|Mind (thinking, reasoning, remembering), emotions (joy, fear, sorrow, affection), personality, self‑consciousness, ordinary will, “heart” as seat of thoughts and feelings in many texts|Middle layer between body and spirit; mediates spiritual condition into thoughts, feelings, choices that then act through the body|
|Spirit|HE [רוּחַ (*ruach*)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7307.htm); GR [πνεῦμα (*pneuma*)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4151.htm); GR [πνευματικός (*pneumatikos*, “spiritual”)](https://biblehub.com/greek/4152.htm); GR [καρδία (*kardia*, heart)](https://biblehub.com/greek/2588.htm) when viewed as deepest God‑ward core|God‑ward, worship‑facing part|Capacity for faith, worship, repentance, communion with God, reception of revelation, “inner man,” where new birth and the indwelling Holy Spirit are located, conscience in many trichotomist schemes|Highest, innermost center meant to be ruled by the Holy Spirit and to govern the soul, which in turn governs the body|

##### 2. Dichotomy: biblical and lexical case

Dichotomists say Scripture ultimately recognizes only two constituent elements: material body and immaterial inner life (soul/spirit).

###### Overlap of “soul” and “spirit”

They emphasize that many passages use ψυχή and πνεῦμα, or נֶפֶשׁ and רוּחַ, in overlapping ways for the inner person.

Examples often cited:

* Mary: “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior” (Luke 1:46–47) – a classic parallelism, not a two‑part analysis of her inner self. See [ThirdMill](https://thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/file/40572).
* Life vs. soul vs. spirit in contexts like Matthew 10:28; James 2:26, where “soul” can function as “life/person” and “spirit” as the animating principle, but both refer to the same inner reality from different angles. See [Equip / CRI](https://www.equip.org/perspectives/body-soul-and-spirit-monism-dichotomy-or-trichotomy/).
* Isaiah 26:9 – “My soul longs for you… my spirit within me earnestly seeks you,” another parallelism dichotomists read as stylistic, not ontological. See this [discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/608221003517691/posts/1119825459023907/).

###### Word-study counterpoints

* נֶפֶשׁ (*nephesh*) very often = “living being, person,” not a separable inner part; when God withdraws *ruach* (breath/spirit), the *nephesh* dies. See [YRM](https://yrm.org/difference-soul-spirit-man/).
* רוּחַ (*ruach*) and נֶפֶשׁ (*nephesh*) are distinct words, but both contribute to describing one living person; Scripture never clearly says humans are made of “three substances.” See [ThirdMill](https://thirdmill.org/answers/answer.asp/file/40572).
* ψυχή and πνεῦμα can be used interchangeably for the inner life (e.g., some texts speak of the soul departing at death, others the spirit). See [GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/body-soul-spirit.html).

Dichotomists conclude:

* The Bible consistently distinguishes only **body** vs. **inner person**.
* “Soul” and “spirit” are two perspectives or functions of the same immaterial aspect: “spirit” when viewed as God‑related and “soul” when viewed as life/self in relation to the world. See [ChristoPress](https://www.christopress.com/trichotomy-vs-dichotomy-the-biblical-and-theological-survey-of-mans-composition-2/).
* 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12 are best read as rhetorical fullness (like “heart, soul, mind, strength” in Mark 12:30), not as a technical parts‑list. See [Tabletalk Magazine](https://tabletalkmagazine.com/article/2022/09/man-as-a-body-soul-composite/).

|Category|Key biblical terms|Core function|What it includes (typical dichotomist view)|Relation to the other category|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Body|σῶμα (*sōma*), σάρξ (*sarx*), בָּשָׂר (*basar*)|Physical, world‑facing aspect|Biological organism, brain and nervous system, senses, physical strength, actions in the visible world|Outward, material aspect of the person; expresses and is directed by the inner person|
|Inner person|ψυχή (*psyche*), πνεῦμα (*pneuma*), נֶפֶשׁ (*nephesh*), רוּחַ (*ruach*), καρδία (*kardia*, heart)|Immaterial, God‑related and self‑related aspect|One inner self that **thinks** (mind), **feels** (emotions), **wills** (choices), is **conscious** of self and God; “soul” = life/self; “spirit” = same inner self viewed in relation to God|Inward, immaterial aspect; “soul” and “spirit” are two perspectives on this same reality, which animates and uses the body|

##### 3. Putting it together

**Why some favor trichotomy (from Bible + word studies):**

* Apparent threefold formulas: “spirit, soul, body” (1 Thessalonians 5:23), and the “division of soul and spirit” (Hebrews 4:12). See [GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/trichotomy-dichotomy.html).
* Lexical distinctions:

  * *Nephesh / psyche* frequently for “life, person,”
  * *Ruach / pneuma* for “spirit” originating from or oriented to God.

* A theological pattern: spirit = God‑ward faculty, soul = self‑ward/earth‑ward faculty, body = world‑contact, which yields a coherent triad in pastoral use. See [BiblicalPsychology](https://biblicalpsychology.net/2026/01/08/trichotomy-biblical-study/).

**Why others remain dichotomists (from Bible + word studies):**

* Strong OT evidence that *nephesh* is often simply “person” or “life,” not a detachable inner part.
* Frequent overlap and parallelism between “soul” and “spirit” in both Testaments, suggesting two angles on one inner life rather than two entities. See this [discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/608221003517691/posts/1119825459023907/).
* Caution that building a firm three‑part ontology on a handful of triadic texts risks over‑reading stylistic or rhetorical fullness. See [Tabletalk Magazine](https://tabletalkmagazine.com/article/2022/09/man-as-a-body-soul-composite/).

In summary, the **trichotomy** case leans on a small cluster of triadic texts and nuanced lexical distinctions between soul and spirit, while the **dichotomy** case leans on the broad, overlapping usage of those same terms and the pervasive twofold pattern of body + inner person across Scripture. See [Equip / CRI](https://www.equip.org/perspectives/body-soul-and-spirit-monism-dichotomy-or-trichotomy/).

#### Theo's Framework:  There are three separate parts however Mind sits as the overlap of body and soul

Oftentimes, a historical context of the argument has been between dichotomy and tricotomy. I fundamentally believe that this is the wrong framework and has never been crisply described, although I think the scripture makes a strong argument for the following. Part of this is due to the idea of the Venn diagram. We need to recognize that God allows us to discover tools for us to not only understand science and math, but also to understand the scripture. It is an illuminating concept to understand how a Venn diagram works.

The main concept behind a Venn diagram is is that you can have two different elements and then the overlap of these two different elements creates a 3rd element That third element will have attributes of both of the elements but is clearly separate and reacts differently than the two elements that it is comprised of.

In my framework for thinking about how mankind was created, it is as simple as saying that we are body and spirit. What is missing in most understanding of this framework is the idea that there is an overlap between these two areas. This, in essence, is the mind. Now, the mind, as we think about it, is an English concept and cannot find a clear analogy in terms of either Hebrew or Koine Greek. However, this does not matter because we have gained an intrinsic understanding of how the mind actually operates. With one of the most critical understanding is the idea of behavioral economics.

Behavioral economics has completely redefined how we should think about how our brain operates. And this breakthrough for this methodology resulted in the Nobel Prize being awarded to Daniel common and sadly his partner Alvin Tversky had already passed. However, this methodology is clear, sustainable, and understood in terms of biological reactions and testing. Inside of this framework, the mind is considered as System 1 and System 2. This framework is highly compatible with the scriptures and seemingly looks like it echoes the idea of heart and what the Greeks would call mind. So in this light, I offer the following dichotomous framing to introduce that even though we are made up of two substances, indeed there is a third part which we would call the mind in English, which captures the other aspects of how we are to express ourselves in the the Shema.
