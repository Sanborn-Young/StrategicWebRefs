#### Problem Statement:  Dallas Willard creates a structure which has many thoughtful and good ideas but this stands in contrast with what the traditional historical teachings of the Church.  This note is to simply provide a framework for discussing the historic views of the Church to allow a thoughtful engagement with Willard's system.

In chapter two of his book, Willard uses the Shema (as quoted by Jesus in Luke 10:25‑28) as the structural center of his whole argument about what a human being is and what spiritual formation must aim at.  He then creates a system but it stands in contrast to the traditional views covered in most churches and theologies. This note is to help understand the common viewpoint, and allow the group to contrast this to Willard's viewpoint to examine where they overlap and how they differ.

In essence, Willard's structure is listed below where the soul is the integrator of all the parts. Without getting into the details, it may be possible to support the soul superstructure from a Hebrew standpoint, but stands in contrast with the theology of the Chruch at the time of Jesus Christ, and the theology that developed by the early church forefathers.

In Willard's framework the outside layer is the soul, and it has multiple layers until you get to the will/heart/spirit, which he says are the same thing.

First, we'll take a look at the creation account. This is a straightforward story that becomes the basis of virtually every understanding of man's unique nature.

Once that is established we'll then take a look at the theologies that emerged after the new testament and the events of the new testament happened.

#### Genesis as the foundation model for our creation

Genesis lays out in clear and unambiguous terms how man was created. So we need to take a look at this as our base level of understanding about the architecture of humans.

> “Then the Lord God formed the man of the dust ([עָפָר aphar](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6083.htm)) from the ground ([אֲדָמָה adamah](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/127.htm)) and breathed the breath ([נִשְׁמַת neshamah](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5397.htm)) of life ([חַיִּים chayyim](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/2416.htm)) into his nostrils, and the man became a living being ([נֶפֶשׁ nephesh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5315.htm)).” 
> 
> ***— Genesis 2:7***

##### Narrative explanation

Dust and ground are tightly coupled together, so you should think as clearly speaking to the same substance. 

However breath and life in the Old Testament are clearly separate concepts, and although it is God's breath that carries life, they are two ideas that are not from the same root or concept.

In this verse, Genesis presents humanity as coming into existence through two coordinated acts. First, God forms a physical body from “dust” (*aphar*) taken from the “ground” (*adamah*), highlighting that our bodily nature is material, earthly, and creaturely. Secondly, God personally breathes into that formed dirt his “breath” (*neshamah*) of “life” (*chayyim*), so that the man becomes a living *nephesh*, a living person.

Although this is clearly anthropomorphized, it is also deeply rich symbolism: the very essence of what is inside of God, his breath which clearly signifies the aspect of who he is, carries his power when it is placed into dirt, so much so that a unique being is created and thus we get the story of Adam and Eve.

This pattern allows us to speak of two aspects or “parts” of man without separating them into independent entities. The *aphar/adamah* language stresses the bodily, physical aspect, while the *neshamah/chayyim* language points to the God-given life-principle that animates that body. When these come together, the result is not just a body plus something added, but a unified living being (*nephesh*), an embodied soul whose life and breath are derived from God Himself.

#### The Bible Is Not Clear How We Are To Think Of Exactly Our Construction

The scripture clearly teaches that God is Spirit. Then as we move through the Bible, especially into Pauline Theology, we are taught that our spirit interacts with the Holy Spirit.  The Gospel of John is pivotal in describing being born again as being born of both water and spirit with most classical interpretation to signify that we have a new spiritual birth, and we are regenerated when we come to salvation in our spirit.

However, when we take a look at the Greek of the New Testament, we see that there are two words that are commonly used, which the Church has had a debate over thousands of years if these are truly too different things or if they are the same thing:  Spirit vs. Soul.  These are two different greek words:  Pneuma or spirit and psyche or soul.

Pneuma dominates Gospels (spirit/wind/breath); psyche (soul/life) appears ~20 times, mostly life/self (e.g., Matthew 16:26 "soul").

#### Dichotomy versus Trichotomy perception of man

This has turned into a debate which is commonly called dichotomy versus trichotomy, and debated since early in the Christian church. 

See table below for how this expresses itself in the Church's creeds or confessions or teachers. 

| View        | Creeds / Confessions (explicit or assumed) | Representative theologians & teachers (clear public stance) |

See: [Augustine – Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo). |

**Chuck Smith quote (trichotomy)**

> “But because God, you see is a superior Trinity, Father, Son and Spirit. I am an inferior Trinity, spirit, soul and body. I meet God in the realm of the spirit.”  
> — Chuck Smith, cited in [Trichotomy – Calvary Chapel Wiki](http://calvarychapel.pbworks.com/w/page/13146689/trichotomy) and discussed in [Trichotomy – Modern Reformation](https://www.modernreformation.org/resources/articles/trichotomy).

I would suggest that Chuck Smith has verbalized what you may naturally think if we were built in the image of God: the Godhead as the Trinity. If God in his very nature, is one substance with three beings, maybe humans should be three things inside of one person.

##### Trichotomy and Dichotomy Side by Side

The table below lays out how both views regard the body much the same. 

It is the Trichotomy viewpoint that further separates soul and spirit into two different parts.  The definitions of the body are in the second and third column, meanwhile, the non-body parts are laid out in the last three columns.  

| Elements      | Trichotomy: Body                     | Dichotomy: Body                       | Trichotomy: Soul                          | Trichotomy: Spirit                                  | Dichotomy: Soul/Spirit (one immaterial part)                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consciousness | World-consciousness (through senses) | World-consciousness                   | Self-consciousness (aware of “me”)        | God-consciousness (aware of God)                    | Self- and God-consciousness together                           |
| Processing    | Organism (11 systems)                | Organism (11 systems)                 | Intellect (analysis, reasoning, planning) | Intuition (spiritual discernment)                   | Intellect and intuition (reasoning and spiritual discernment)  |
| Reaction      | Instinct (survival responses)        | Instinct (survival responses)         | Emotion (fear, joy, anger, etc.)          | Conscience (moral awareness of good/evil)           | Emotion and conscience (feelings and moral awareness together) |
| Action        | Drive (hunger, thirst, sex, etc.)    | Drive (bodily appetites and impulses) | Volition (choosing, resolving, deciding)  | Communion (love and fellowship with God and others) | Volition and communion (choices and relational love)           |
| Life          | Biological life (bios)               | Biological life (bios)                | Psychological life (psuche – soul-life)   | Spiritual life (zoe – life from God)                | Inner life as one whole (psuche and zoe viewed inseparably)    |

The following table now lays two more structures which are spoken about in Scripture. The mind and the heart overlay and both reside in the spirit and inside of the soul in this framework. The table over states how much the mind and heart exclusively lays inside the soul. In this particular model, these separate spiritual part influences the when you are with God, and the influence of the Spirit on the soul then also shapes our heart and our mind.

| Basic definition       | The inner, immaterial self; the seat of personality and “I am,” containing both mind and heart as its main faculties.                                                         | The rational faculty **within the soul** that thinks, reasons, and interprets life; this same mind can run on merely natural assumptions (soul operating on its own) or be illuminated and directed by the spirit’s light and truth (soul under spirit).        | The affective–volitional center **within the soul** where desires, loves, and core commitments reside; these same loves can be self-centered (soul acting independently) or reoriented by the spirit toward God and neighbor (soul aligned with spirit).          | The God-aware, God-responsive core of a person, designed for worship, fellowship, and reception of God’s life.            |
| Main role              | Holds together thoughts, emotions, and will as a unified inner person that can either resist or cooperate with the spirit.                                                    | Processes beliefs, interpretations, and plans as the “control room” of the soul; when the spirit is ignored, the mind leans on human wisdom, but when the spirit is heeded, the mind becomes a channel for spiritual discernment and “mind of Christ” thinking. | Steers what the person treasures, chooses, and clings to at a deep level; without the spirit’s influence the heart defaults to disordered loves, but under the spirit’s work the same heart becomes the place where new priorities and holy affections take root. | Brings God-consciousness, revelation, and power that penetrate and transform the soul’s mind and heart.                   |
| Relation to trichotomy | One of the three “parts” (body–soul–spirit), representing the whole psychological and relational self that is shaped from above by the spirit and expressed through the body. | A faculty **inside the soul**, not a separate part; it is the interface where the spirit’s insight translates into new thoughts, renewed perspectives, and spiritually informed judgments within the soul’s ordinary cognitive processes.                       | A faculty **inside the soul**, not a separate part; it is the interface where the spirit’s presence translates into new desires, reordered loves, and deeper loyalty to God within the soul’s ordinary emotional and volitional life.                             | A distinct immaterial part that interfaces with God and then influences the soul (mind, heart) and, through it, the body. |
| Relation to spirit     | The soul as a whole is progressively reshaped as the spirit, enlivened by God, works its life and insight into both mind and heart.                                           | The spirit enlightens and renews the mind by feeding it truth, convicting error, and giving spiritual understanding, so the same soul-mind begins to think God’s thoughts after Him rather than merely reflecting natural or cultural patterns.                 | The spirit softens and redirects the heart by exposing false loves, healing wounds, and pouring in God’s love, so the same soul-heart learns to desire God’s will, delight in what is good, and choose sacrificial love.                                          | Receives, hosts, and transmits God’s life, truth, and love into the soul’s mind and heart, and out into behavior.         |
#### Trichotomy Diagram

While trichotomy as an overlap of mind body and spirit has been utilized for centuries there are no clean definitions of how exactly to think of everything. However there is clear overlap between all of the different areas. For the purpose of discussion, the following Venn diagram is offered as a of potential framework of how somebody could apply this particular design to thinking about the various aspects of how mankind was created by God. While it may be stated that the mind and heart is primarily in the soul, I believe everybody whose trichonymous would state that the soul has influence on the spirit and the spirit on the sole and thus all of these in some way overlap.

#### The Gospels

Both schools will argue that the text from the Gospels could support their contention. 

| Reference (Gospels)                         | Text (ESV excerpt, shortened)                                                                                                                                                           | How it is usually taken in the debate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Matthew 22:37 (par. Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27) | “You shall love the Lord your God with all your **heart** and with all your **soul** and with all your **mind** (and with all your **strength** – Mark; Luke).”                         | Often cited by **trichotomists** as showing multiple inner “parts” (heart, soul, mind) plus bodily strength.  Appears to be weak simply because the term soul and spirit is not inside of the text. If to be supportive of this view then both would be listed.  It is without doubt that the calls out separate parts regardless of being dichotomy or trichotomy. |
| Matthew 10:28                               | “Do not fear those who kill the **body** but cannot kill the **soul**. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”                                                     | Classic **dichotomy** text in the Gospels: Jesus distinguishes body from an immaterial soul that survives bodily death, but he does not add “spirit” as a third component. This is routinely used to support a two‑part (body + inner person) view.                                                                                                                 |
| Luke 1:46–47                                | “My **soul** magnifies the Lord, and my **spirit** rejoices in God my Savior.”                                                                                                          | Sometimes used by **trichotomists** to argue that “soul” and “spirit” are distinct. Many commentators reply that Hebrew‑style parallelism is in view: “soul” and “spirit” are poetic near‑synonyms for the same inner self praising God, which better supports **dichotomy/holistic** anthropology than a rigid three‑part scheme.                                  |
| John 3:5–6                                  | “Unless one is born of water and the **Spirit**, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the **flesh** is flesh, and that which is born of the **Spirit** is spirit.” | Echoed later by Paul, this passage sets **flesh** against **Spirit** as two orders of life, not as two compartments alongside “soul.” It is therefore typically read as fitting a **dichotomous** (or even more simply, “old vs. new life”) framework: one person can live in the flesh or in the Spirit.                                                           |
| John 12:27                                  | “Now is my **soul** troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’?”                                                                                                  | Jesus speaks of his “soul” as his deeply troubled inner life. No separate “spirit” is mentioned here, so this verse is usually taken as neutral but compatible with **dichotomy** (body plus inner self) rather than as evidence for a three‑part division.                                                                                                         |
| Matthew 26:41 (par. Mark 14:38)             | “The **spirit** indeed is willing, but the **flesh** is weak.”                                                                                                                          | Like John 3, this uses a twofold contrast—spirit vs. flesh—as two aspects or orientations of the same disciples, not a full inventory of human parts. Interpreters generally see this as supporting a practical **dichotomy** (inner willing vs. bodily weakness) rather than trichotomy.                                                                           |
| Luke 23:46                                  | “Father, into your hands I commit my **spirit**!”                                                                                                                                       | Frequently used to show that at death the immaterial self (“spirit”) can be entrusted to God apart from the body, which fits a **dichotomous** understanding (body and inner spirit/soul) but does not itself distinguish soul from spirit as two separate immaterial entities.                                                                                     |

#### Pauline writings

Paul's central role in sight of the Church was to create a formalized theology around the general narrative of the gospel. His first text listed below is often cited as to support trichotomy. However similar to the Gospels Paul does not support consistent usage of all these terms together.

| 1 Thessalonians 5:23        | “May your whole **spirit and soul and body** be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”                                                                                                                                      | Classic **trichotomy** proof‑text: three terms listed together. Dichotomists answer that Paul is piling up near‑synonyms (like “heart, soul, mind, strength”) as a way of saying “your whole person,” not giving a parts‑list.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1 Corinthians 14:14–15      | “If I pray in a tongue, my **spirit** prays but my **mind** is unfruitful… I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also.”                                                                                                   | Trichotomists sometimes cite this as showing a human spirit distinct from the mind/soul. Dichotomists argue Paul is distinguishing modes of activity within one inner life (non‑cognitive vs. cognitive) rather than separate “parts,” so it fits **dichotomy** better.                                                                                                         |
| 1 Corinthians 2:14–3:1      | “The **natural [psychikos] person** does not accept the things of the Spirit of God… But the **spiritual [pneumatikos] person** judges all things… I… could not address you as spiritual people, but as **people of the flesh [sarkinos]**.” | Some trichotomists see three categories (soulish, spiritual, fleshly) hinting at body–soul–spirit. Many commentators respond that Paul is contrasting life ruled by the Spirit versus life ruled by the “flesh,” and “psychikos” means ordinary, earthly life, not a third substantial part; this supports a **functional dichotomy** (outer vs. inner under different powers). |
| Romans 8:4–13               | “…those who live according to the **flesh** set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the **Spirit** set their minds on the things of the Spirit.”                                                         | Central for **dichotomy**: “flesh” and “Spirit” are two spheres or powers under which the one human self can live, not two compartments alongside “soul.” Paul’s focus is old‑age vs. new‑age existence, not three‑part psychology.                                                                                                                                             |
| Galatians 5:16–25           | “Walk by the **Spirit**, and you will not gratify the desires of the **flesh**. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit…”                                                                                                        | Again supports **dichotomy** in practice: Paul contrasts two masters (flesh vs. Spirit) contending for the same heart and body, not three components. The “works of the flesh” and “fruit of the Spirit” describe moral orientation of the whole person.                                                                                                                        |
| 2 Corinthians 4:16–5:4      | “Though our **outer self** is wasting away, our **inner self** is being renewed day by day… For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling.”                                                                             | Frequently cited for **dichotomy**: Paul gives a twofold schema—outer vs. inner person—rather than body–soul–spirit. The inner person (heart, mind, spirit) is one reality that will eventually be clothed with a renewed body.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Philippians 1:20–24         | “…it is my eager expectation… that Christ will be honored in my **body**, whether by life or by death… My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.”                                                                   | Used for **dichotomy**: Paul can imagine himself existing “with Christ” apart from the present body, which suggests a basic two‑element view (body and an immaterial self) rather than three separable immaterial parts.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1 Corinthians 15:42–49      | “It is sown a **natural [psychikos] body**; it is raised a **spiritual [pneumatikos] body**… The first man Adam became a living **soul [psychē]**; the last Adam became a life‑giving **spirit [pneuma]**.”                                  | Trichotomists sometimes see body–soul–spirit terminology here. But many Pauline specialists argue that “psychikos” vs. “pneumatikos” describes what *animates* the body (present life vs. Spirit‑given life), not its number of parts, so the passage supports an integrated, essentially **dichotomous** view.                                                                 |
| Ephesians 4:22–24           | “…put off your old self… and be renewed in the **spirit of your minds**, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God…”                                                                                                        | Paul stacks “spirit” and “mind” language but uses it to describe one renewed inner person. Interpreters therefore treat this as **dichotomy** language: one inner self being transformed, not separate soul and spirit layers.                                                                                                                                                  |

#### The Rest of The New Testament

In the rest of the New Testament, We get various authors often prized for new and insightful angles on things that helps illuminate the other sections of the New Testament. However in this case, the writings don't seem to offer clear and convincing contra evidence to one viewpoint or the other..

| Reference (non‑Gospel, non‑Pauline NT) | Text (ESV excerpt, shortened) | How it is usually taken in the debate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hebrews 4:12 | “The word of God… piercing to the division of **soul and of spirit**, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” | One of the main **trichotomy** proof‑texts: explicitly mentions “soul and spirit” as if separable. Dichotomists counter that the pairing is like “joints and marrow, thoughts and intentions”—a rhetorical way of saying God’s word reaches to the deepest recesses of the one inner person, so it need not imply two different immaterial substances. |
| James 2:26 | “For as the **body** apart from the **spirit** is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.” | Standard **dichotomy** text: life is body + spirit together; death is their separation. “Soul” is not added as a third term, so the verse naturally reads as body vs. spirit/inner life. |
| 1 Peter 1:8–9 | “…you believe in him and rejoice… obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your **souls**.” | Often used broadly for **dichotomy/holistic dualism**: “souls” here stands for the whole inner life/person that is saved. It does not set soul over against spirit, so it is neutral for strict trichotomy but fits easily with a two‑part (body and inner person) view. |
| 1 Peter 3:18–19 | “…put to death in the **flesh** but made alive in the **spirit**, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison.” | Sometimes drawn into the discussion as showing Jesus’ human existence in flesh vs. in spirit. Most interpreters take this as **dichotomous/functional** (earthly bodily life vs. resurrection/Spirit sphere) rather than a map of three human parts. |
| Revelation 6:9 | “I saw under the altar the **souls** of those who had been slain for the word of God…” | Used for **dichotomy**: disembodied “souls” consciously exist apart from their bodies, indicating at least two distinguishable elements (body and an immaterial self). The text does not distinguish soul from spirit, so it does not directly support trichotomy. |
| Revelation 20:4 | “I saw the **souls** of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus… They came to life and reigned with Christ…” | Similar to Revelation 6:9, this is taken to support **dichotomy**: “souls” represent the conscious inner persons awaiting bodily resurrection. Again, no separate “spirit” term is used. |

#### The final wrap up

Now I lay me down to sleep,
> I pray the Lord my Soul to keep
> If I should die before I 'wake,
> I pray the Lord my Soul to take.

The earliest version was written by George Wheler in his 1698 book The Protestant Monastery.

This very simple Christian prayer has been said for over 300 years in the English world by countless million of children and adults as a ritual before they went to sleep. Regardless if you are a triconomist or a dichonomist, the theology behind this prayer is simple. That we have a physical body which will pass away in a spiritual part which we want our God to take upon our death.

And this framework has been widely accepted by the Church as a prayer devotion which which was theologically correct.

In Willard's framework, it would make no sense for the Lord to take your soul because the soul becomes basically a superset of many other things, including the body. 

There are avenues to argue that Willard's framework could be correct or shed new light on things. However, it's important to understand that this framework is different than the very simple methodology which has been laid out over the centuries. And therefore, if we use it to help construct our own framework, we should understand that that it is different than perhaps what most Christians seen as what they have been taught.
