The idea of keeping a notebook, or a place for you to work things out, echoes the habits of many of the best minds that have ever walked the earth. When we look at their notebooks, we get a real sense of how these practices were formative and how they helped shape who those people became. By getting something down outside of yourself, you give your mind more room to move and you become a deeper, more thoughtful individual.

The following is just a partial list, and it shows how this idea of keeping a notebook or journal shows up across different disciplines:

Sometimes figures have a rich legacy of writing letters to other people, and in some ways this can substitute for keeping a notebook. In my mind, though, this is a poor secondary way of working out how to be productive. If all you are doing is firing off one-liners or endlessly scrolling Reddit, you are going to sub-optimize your productivity.

So now let us think through the various reasons that we actually do want to have something down, something that lives inside a notebook or a journal.

Writing things down helps because it changes how your brain encodes information, how you regulate emotion, and how you externalize and rework your own thoughts.

## Deeper encoding and memory

Handwriting forces active processing, because you can’t write as fast as you think, so you have to summarize, translate ideas into your own words, and choose what matters, which strengthens elaborative encoding and long-term memory. Brain and imaging studies show that handwriting engages broader networks for movement, vision, memory, and higher-order thinking than typing, and students who handwrite notes generally recall concepts better than those who simply transcribe lectures on laptops.

## Offloading working memory and reducing cognitive load

I am a [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_%28author%29), [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) fan, which will be obvious if you read this subreddit at all. One of the things about David Allen is that he has incorporated his thoughts into a system that I do not believe many people can actually implement fully. However, his thinking around that system is genuinely insightful and helpful. One of the main ideas he continuously pounds on is getting things out of your brain. You need some tool to capture everything. The moment you have an external tool, the burden on your back goes down massively. He has this concept of an “open loop.” An open loop is when you know you need to do something and you are afraid you are going to forget it. His view is that you have to close that open loop or subconsciously you are going to stay stressed. For some people, this is completely revolutionary and relieves a massive load they have been carrying. I would suggest that regardless of whether you adopt his full system or not, having an external offloading tool is incredibly important for your mental health.

Writing creates an external buffer so that instead of juggling ideas in the very limited space of working memory, you park them on the page and free up mental bandwidth for pattern recognition and insight. This offloading reduces extraneous cognitive load, which makes it easier to see connections, reorganize information, and solve problems creatively. This is why even a rough sketch of a problem or a quick list of constraints can suddenly make a solution feel obvious.

Finally, we can also think about what would sort of look like a conflict. On one sense, in the above we want to encode and memorize something in our brain, and in this one we're talking about taking stuff out of our brain and putting it on the outside. This is actually a circle which works very heavily within itself. For example, you have some jumbled-up thoughts on a subject you want to learn. So you decide you're actually going to go write it down. Now that it is written down, you go make flashcards. By having flashcards, you then quiz yourself and suddenly it gets encoded back into your brain better.

## Slowing down to think

Because writing is slower than either thinking or typing, it naturally slows your mind enough for you to examine assumptions, notice implications, and avoid default reactions. That enforced pacing supports deeper comprehension instead of surface-level skimming, so a half-page of handwritten reflection on a decision often brings out trade-offs and consequences you glossed over when everything stayed in your head.

## Emotional processing and self-regulation

Expressive writing experiments show that writing about stressful or emotional events can improve physical health, mood, and overall functioning over time, even though it may feel difficult in the moment. The mechanism appears to be emotional labeling and cognitive reappraisal. Putting feelings into words transforms raw emotion into a structured narrative, which reduces inhibition and physiological stress. People who journal about difficult experiences often show short-term distress while writing, but better mental and physical health in the months that follow.

## Building a reflective self-model

Regular journaling creates a time series of your own mind. You can literally look back at your patterns, beliefs, and mistakes on the page, which strengthens metacognition and supports behavior change. Over time this written history lets you infer things like “when I think or feel X, I usually do Y and regret it,” which makes it easier to choose better actions in the present. That reflective loop is a big reason people describe journaling as making them more self-aware or grounded.

## Generative space for insight and creativity

A blank page provides an unstructured idea sandbox where you can mix sketches, arrows, marginalia, and partial thoughts in ways that linear tools do not support. This encourages divergent thinking and unexpected combinations. The looser format and sensory feedback of handwriting, the movement of the pen, the layout on the page, and the spatial placement, are associated with richer ideation than constrained digital input. Outlining, mind-mapping, or freewriting on paper often surfaces connections you never see when ideas stay purely in your head.

## Turning intentions into commitments

Writing goals, next actions, and plans down makes them concrete and visible, which substantially increases the likelihood of follow-through compared with keeping them in your head. The act of writing itself functions as a micro-commitment and creates external cues, lists, checkboxes, and pages that you see again, so a daily planning page or action list can make you more productive even if nothing else about your environment changes.

## Putting it all together

You may have just blasted through the above and noticed that there are some good ideas here. You probably want to move from simply seeing a list of ideas to actually having them stick in your brain. One of the best ways to do this is to set up a list and think about how these factors interact with each other. Do they overlap, or are they truly orthogonal? That is, if you do one, does it influence the others or not? The table below helps you think that through. The reason to walk through the table is that it will help cement why each of these mechanisms matters, how they overlap, and it will give you better conviction about why you write things down and how it is going to organize your brain in the future.

In the above, I pointed out how encoding in memory is helped by offload and loading. I used the flashcards as an example. You can go through the table below and see how each one of these things are related. Now, my table may not be perfect. The real point is for you to think through the table and think to yourself if the stars are wrong or right.

**One star is low, three stars is high.**

## Summary

I hope I have convinced you that you need to spend some time every day putting something down in some kind of notebook. I believe that [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)), as we move into an age of AI, is an incredible tool to help you become more productive. I will do a future post on why I think this is true.
