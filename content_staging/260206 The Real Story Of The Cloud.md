One of this subreddit's favorite stock choices is [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)). This is because they have a great engine in [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) and continue to be the single largest threat when it comes to dominating the retail market in the United States. Their revenue growth remains extremely strong, and their business model is highly effective, where the retail side feeds cash into AWS.

Yesterday, during their earnings call, Amazon announced they would need to invest around $200 million in [capital expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure). Traders saw this as a potentially negative signal, which pushed the stock down after hours and carried into the next day. Many people expected this possibility. If you look at Amazon’s stock over the last week or so, you’ll see it has fallen significantly in overall value.

I believe there is strong analysis happening on the sell side, but even they often fail to highlight the bigger strategic picture of what’s happening across the industry. Once you really understand that context, it reframes everything.

The first point to address is the idea that Amazon will need to take on debt for the CapEx. This narrative appears in a few places where people haven’t looked closely at Amazon’s financial model. If you review Amazon’s cash generation model, they are essentially reinvesting all their [free cash flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow) into growth. This approach is not very different from what Amazon has been doing for the past 25 years. If they do take on more debt, it would be almost trivial. A look at their financial statements shows they clearly understand their business model and the limits of their cash flow, which effectively defines how much they can reinvest.

The second point is that Amazon is projected to grow from about $590 billion in revenue in 2025 to around $650 billion in 2026. That’s a 10% annual increase, or roughly $60 billion in additional revenue. Amazon has incredible depth in [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and robotics, and as their scale grows, it allows them to continuously reduce costs across their structure. The retail moat around Amazon is widening to the point where it’s becoming nearly impossible for competitors to catch up.

In reality, $200 million in capital expenditure, especially to support their retail operations, is not significant. It fits comfortably within their business model. Amazon’s investment level still won’t match [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)’s, even though Amazon’s overall business is larger. So in that sense, it’s a rational move. Is that a lot of money? Sure, but it keeps Amazon on par with Microsoft, who has always been their primary challenger. However, the real issue now is a juggernaut called [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google).

For years, it was always a two-horse race—with Amazon leading and Microsoft slowly catching up. Many expected Amazon’s lead to erode faster than it has, but instead, it has been a slow, steady contest. [Cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) via AWS has consistently invested in line with its business model, delivering strong growth and solid returns.

The big news now is that Google, the smallest player in cloud computing, is investing far beyond what anyone else is committing. More importantly, Google is leveraging its own internal architecture for AI inference, which means that if executed correctly, they’ll have an extremely cost-efficient platform. They are also proving their ability to produce world-class models independently—something neither Microsoft nor Amazon has truly done yet. That’s the real story of this earnings season: not that Amazon is maintaining a realistic CapEx budget, but that Google is swinging for the fences.

It has long been one of my core views that any forecast should start with the trend lines. So this analysis begins with two: the overall growth of the cloud business and the CapEx trajectories. If you extend Google’s growth line, they’re on track to surpass Microsoft around 2029. By 2027, they’re expected to outspend everyone in capital investment—mostly targeting AI infrastructure. If there’s one headline takeaway, it’s that Google is swinging for the fences. They may strike out, or they may become the home-run king.

However, Google still depends heavily on its [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine) business, which has remained remarkably strong. Compared to early predictions, search has far exceeded expectations. Google wouldn’t be able to justify the scale of its current CapEx commitments if search revenue weren’t performing so well. That said, using Google search remains central to their ecosystem.

Google openly states that their AI engine is not ad-sponsored, which is accurate, since an ad-heavy AI experience could alienate users. They’ve managed to walk a careful line. If you use Google, you’ll notice that the primary entry point is still the search bar. Once you run a query, you basically have two choices: review traditional search results or get an AI-generated answer. The AI responses are high-level and give the impression of sophistication, but they often lack depth. This approach is intentional—if Google offered too powerful an AI result, it would cannibalize traditional search results so deeply that their overall business model could collapse.

Google has a long history of understanding trade-offs like this. If you’ve read the history of Google, one reason they initially won was their text-based search interface, which loaded fast and beat competitors whose pages loaded more slowly. That, along with [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), was the foundation of Google’s early dominance. They recognize that something as simple as page load speed made the difference between becoming the industry leader or an afterthought.

The question now is whether you, as a Google user, find yourself gravitating more toward AI answers than traditional search results. Will these two modes of search—traditional and AI—coexist in a way that protects Google’s revenue? I’m skeptical. I think AI will inevitably cannibalize search, slowly at first, then rapidly. We’re still early in that transition, but this is the number one trend to watch. If AI cannibalizes Google’s search revenue, it will seriously weaken their ability to sustain their long-term strategy. But if they can preserve that revenue, they have a real chance of becoming the home-run king.
