Today we're going to take a look at taking paper notes.  But interestingly enough, I'm going to disappoint you in that I'm not even going to give an answer. What we're going to do today is we're going to ask ourselves, have we ever thought about this deeply? And if we did think about it deeply, how does it change the way that we would approach which is something.

It's really not about taking notes. What it's about is how do we use our system 2 thinking to examine an area that you probably have not thought deeply about because you have a blind spot. In other words, there's many things in life we do and we don't even realize how much we've sub-optimized ourselves. So we need to have ways of thinking through things to become more productive. Otherwise, our blind spots take over and we miss great opportunities.

So before you read any further, I would encourage you to take out whatever notebook you have and simply spend 60 to 90 seconds writing down if it is better for you to take written notes or if it's better for you to take electronic notes. I know it's going to be so tempting for you to continue to scroll down this page and simply read something that I'm going to write in a few paragraphs. 

But if you do this, you are going to shortcut an incredible, valuable opportunity. If you can just stop for a moment and say I ran across this post and it's asking me to stop for a minute and list things out, I believe the following will become tenfold as productive because it's going to show you how to think and different tools to think about things differently.

I would submit to you, if you are a knowledge worker, there is an incredible return on thinking deeply about how to gather and utilize a notebook. In terms of my mental sanity and my financial return, it turns out this mundane subject has a mass of return on investment.

When you're trying to figure out how to make a decision, the most important thing that you can do is not start off with saying, "well, I take paper notes or I take electronic notes, let me write down the two or three different reasons that I'm doing it." What you want to actually do is start off as a problem statement and then what you do is conceptually you start to think through "hey if I wanted to go solve this problem statement What are the criteria that are important in me solving the problem statement?"

Once you have the criteria, you will unlock making good decisions and making bad decisions.

I want to emphasize, I always try to start off any post in this with either true insight or real research, and in this particular field, the research is incredibly deep, both at what I would call the easy level and at the academic level. At the end of this day, the decisions you make about even mundane things are often done using poor thinking.  Below, we'll list a resource table of some of the seminal thinkers about making the decisions that we make. Some of these you'll see have been brought up multiple times inside of this subreddit.

Again, because I brought up David Allen so much, one of the fascinating things about his system is that most people don't understand his system actually looks like a productivity system, but in reality, it's a decision-making system. It just masquerades and hides as a productivity system.

So let's go ahead and list criteria for why you would want to do something by a pen and paper or why you would want to do things by electronic notes. I'm hoping before you got to this part in this particular part of the OP, you actually had constructed some criteria. So now compare your criteria to the criteria that I've listed below. And by the way, I'm not even saying I got it all, but I'm saying that I bet I've captured many more criteria than virtually anybody that reads this post. 

Now I want you to take this table, take a look at the 16 different criteria, and then use the last blank column to rank them. It turns out that asking people to rank things in a non-standard way often creates more creativity. So in this case, I'm asking you to rank them between 1 and 7 in the hope that this will get your creative juices going.

And if you really want to make a change in your life, put your ranking of your various factors below in a comment. Expressing your thoughts to other people is the single most effective way of forcing yourself to go through things. By being a bit on stage, your thinking will become much sharper and crisper.
