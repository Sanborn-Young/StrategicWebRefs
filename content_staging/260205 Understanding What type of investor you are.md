#### The Fool’s Game: Trying To Outguess Traders While Calling Yourself An Investor

This subreddit is an investor subreddit. It has been interesting because the Reddit algorithm has pushed this very small backwater subreddit into a couple of larger flows, and some of the posts I have had here have gotten well in excess of 30,000 to 50,000 views, which is a lot. Then, because of these heavy posts, people subscribed to this subreddit, and the number of subscribers has doubled, which is not the goal of the subreddit. The goal of this subreddit is to have a place where you can stop and have somebody force you to think. 

This is called engaging your [System 2 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

It is not apparent to me, as I have read many of these comments, that people understand the difference between an investor and a trader. If you listen to any investing station like CNBC, you will hear these terms thrown around a lot. But again, I would state that most people have not cognitively thought through what the difference actually is.

I think a lot of people believe that they are investors, but their emotions are those of traders. So I write a post on [SanDisk](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNDK) or I write a post on the hard drive makers, and then in a couple of weeks they see an enormous run up, and I have somebody say that the post “weathered well.” A post does not weather well after one or two weeks, a post weathers well after one to two years. If you are looking for a short term boost to your wealth, you are going to be vastly disappointed by trying to buy something based on a recommendation that happens to pop up here. I will guarantee you that I am going to talk about a strategic stock, you will buy it, and then it is going to plummet like a rock. If you have engaged your System 2 thinking, you will have confidence that you know, over the long run, it will pay off, even when it is difficult to see your short term value drop.

The problem with being an investor is thinking that you can close your eyes and disengage from the market. The difficult thing about being an investor is that you actually need to engage with what is happening on a constant basis so that you can pull the trigger maybe once or twice a year. The problem is that the moment you start looking carefully at a stock, you are going to be extremely tempted to start trading it. You read something that makes sense or you do a value equation and suddenly it seems like the thing should move. But in reality, what happens is that the stock itself is thrown into a market that is dominated by traders and not investors.

Traders love to make a stock move one way or the other or rotate in and out. It is a fool’s game to try to outguess these people because they are spending all of their time trying to figure it out. What is ironic about this is that at the end of the day the vast majority of traders do not outperform the [S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC). I have stated this before, but [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) was the king of pointing this out, although it did not start with him, and my finance professor in college pointed this out as well. It is a well known secret that hedge funds, by and large, get lucky, and they attract people by virtue of being lucky and not being good. What is ironic is that you would expect at least 50 percent of hedge funds to do better than the S&P 500, but in reality, if you take a look at hedge funds, something like 70 or 80 percent of them do not do as well as the S&P 500. So, in other words, they are doing worse than what would happen if they simply bought stocks by random chance.

I believe that for most investors, what they should do is index to the S&P 500. I think there is a good argument that the S&P 500 is not going to see some of the traditional returns over the next ten years. However, I still believe it is your best way of engaging with the market. I do believe you can do better than the S&P 500 if you buy what I call [Dragon King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Sornette) stocks. That is why this subreddit was set up, to discuss these Dragon King stocks.

But it is important to note, if I do bring up something that is a Dragon King and will outperform the S&P 500, there is a very good chance that you will need to sit on it for one to two years before this becomes obvious, because traders dominate the short term time horizon.

Now what is completely unfair is that you are going to make very few trades, but unfortunately you actually have to stay on top of your investments every single day. That work is what lets you make one or two investment choices during the year, because the buildup of factors over time has indicated that you suddenly need to move.

I recently called this out for [GLP‑1 drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist). The market is going to be explosive, and if you saw the latest results from [Eli Lilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Lilly_and_Company) ([LLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LLY)), you would think that you would want to continue to plow into Eli Lilly. Unfortunately, we have what I call the drowning man phenomenon. Because [Novo Nordisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novo_Nordisk) ([NVO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVO)) has done so poorly, they have done what I consider extremely stupid things that hurt the overall market, and because of that I have suggested that you should rotate out of GLP‑1 drugs due to the environment. To make this decision, you need to spend every single day understanding what is happening in the market.

Now, we have seen Novo Nordisk already announce that the USA pricing move was going to severely hurt their overall financials. It is beyond conception that they made such a move without actually thinking through what the ramifications would be. They basically agreed with the United States government to drop their pricing, and now their business model is going to suffer because of it. 

Practically, we have not seen it reflected in Eli Lilly’s stock yet, but it is impossible not to recognize that this has added a whole new layer of complexity and risk to our investment in GLP‑1 drugs. This means that we are making a decision today because we constantly monitor the stock, understanding that it may not show up in Eli Lilly’s stock price tactically, or at all. However, we have made the move to be proactive because we understand what is happening in the market.
